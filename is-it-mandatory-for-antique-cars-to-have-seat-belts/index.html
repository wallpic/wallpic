Cops catches the old vehicle drivers just to make fast buck. However you should bear in mind that children under 3 years old will not be able to travel in your vehicle. This is a classic vehicle I want to keep it original and am not interested in retro-fitting anything. Pre-1966 cars were not required by Federal law to install these safety standards.</p>

<p>Austin 3 Litre Advert 1969 British Cars Austin Cars Classic Cars Answer 1 of 7. Post 68 seat belts were mandatory in all seating positions except some types of sideways facing seats. After 1965 every car that carries passengers is required to have at least two shoulder harness type belts in each passenger seat as well as all front seat positions. Therefore if you own a classic car and no seat belts are fitted as standard you have no legal obligation to have them fitted. This type of primary and secondary classification does not apply to child seat belt laws which are typically targeted for children under 8 years old.</p>
