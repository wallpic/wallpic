<p>Pin By Deon Kruger On Automobiles German Barn Find Cars Antique Cars Vintage Mercedes If the car is a special-interest model like your Corvette or an antique or classic car its very likely that at least some of its previous owners belonged to car clubs. Similarly a Vintage Car was built before 1930 and Post Vintage referred to cars from the 30s until the end of WWII however after this point it all becomes a bit hazy. An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law. Some automotive organisations may refer to a car made in the 1940s as a Classic while others my consider cars from the 1980s to Classics. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars.</p>

<p>Pin On Michael If you own a passenger vehicle trailer semi-trailer or motorcycle with a model year that is more than 25 model years old before January 1 of the current calendar year youve got an antique. A classic vs antique car is easily confused but an antique car is older. Typically an antique vehicle is defined by its age at the time at which antique vehicle registration is sought. An antique vehicle adds Greer is generally at least 30 years old which is the minimum age for historic or vintage plates in many provinces. Depending on how you plan to use your vehicle you may choose antique vintage or any one of our standard license plates.</p>

<p>Rare British Racer 1949 Connaught L2 2 Litre Sports Racing Car Sports Car Racing British Sports Cars Car On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years. By contrast American Collectors Insurance says an antique car is one manufactured in 1975 or earlier. State of Connecticut 25 years in the US. The term classic is tossed about quit a lot but there IS a definition of Classic.</p>

<p>Alvis Are Back After A Brief Hiatus With 2016 Classic S Classic Cars Classic Antique Cars State of Virginia 30 years in the Australian state of Queensland 30 years in Sweden and Brazil and 35 years in Singapore. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. For that reason they set rules stating what qualifies as antique In most cases it is a car thats over 45 years old. Its partially a matter of passion.</p>
