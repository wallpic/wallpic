<p>1929 Cord L 29 Town Car By D Ieteren Freres Amelia Island 2013 Rm Auctions Antique Cars Car Stamp In order to qualify for Texas antique vehicle registration your vehicle must be at least 25 years old and can only be used on a limited basis such as car shows exhibitions parades and travel to and from repair and maintenance facilities. The one-time registration means exactly what it says. The fee is 40 if the vehicle was manufactured prior to 1921. To see the restrictions on the use of antiques or to obtain more information on how to register your vehicle as Antique visit the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. You can use YOM Year of Manufacture License Plates so if you have a 53 car find a nice pair of 1953 Texas plates and take them with you when you go to the registration office.</p>
