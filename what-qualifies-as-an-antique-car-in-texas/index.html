The difference in classification comes down to how you use it. The vehicle must be used exclusively for exhibitions club activities parades or other functions of public interest. Some states though allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years while others require it to be older. Cars with an antique plate shall be used only for participation in club activities exhibits tours parades and similar uses but in no event shall it be used for general transportation according to the Delaware DMV.</p>
