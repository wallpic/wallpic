Felons in Florida are prohibited from owning firearms unless their rights have been restored by a court of law. In essence the trial court interpreted section 79023 of the Florida Statutes as prohibiting any firearm whether antique or otherwise from being possessed by a convicted felon. 1 It is unlawful for any person to own or to have in his or her care custody possession or control any firearm ammunition or electric weapon or device or to carry. 22 ruling upheld a lower courts decision to vacate the conviction the Florida Supreme Court did not agree with its finding the states law.</p>

<p>How Long Does A Felony Stay On Your Record In Florida Meltzer Bell P A The Florida Supreme Court has ruled that carrying a replica of an antique gun doesnt violate the states prohibition on felons possessing firearms. On its face the statute provides that the firearm a convicted felon is prohibited from possessing excludes an antique firearm. However Floridas definition of firearms specifically exempts antique firearms and replicas which are defi. Section 7900011 of the Florida Statutes defines antique firearm as follows. Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon in Florida Actual Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon carries a minimum-mandatory prison sentence.</p>

<p>Restoration Of Gun Rights In Florida Pumphrey Law So I found the definition of an antique firearm in the General statue. Last week the Florida Supreme Court issued an opinion clarifying the types of firearms convicted. The October 19 2021. Defendants contention is based on section 79023 Florida Statutes 1983 which prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a firearm unless it is an antique or a replica thereof. This makes it seem like it would be acceptable for a felon to possess an antique firearm so long as they are not using it to commit a crime.</p>
