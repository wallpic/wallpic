<p>Look At The Site Just Press The Tab For Extra Options Dodge Classic Cars Thunderbird Car Old Vintage Cars Buy Classic Cars A subset of what is considered classic cars are known as antique cars manufactured before 1980 or vintage cars manufactured pre-World War II. Ask a random selection of insurance providers and theyll probably all tell you something different. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique. Most insurance companies consider your car an antique or classic if it is at least 15 or 20 years old or older depending on where you live garaged when not in use To find out your states definition of a classic car and how old it must be to be considered a classic. This classification definitely overlaps with antique cars.</p>

<p>Pin On Classic Cars Its partially a matter of passion. For people who have some honesty and common sense but know very little about automobiles a vintage car is probably anything that is obviously not current. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. Antique cars are over 45 years old and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930. But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition.</p>

Certain states have specific designations for antique vehicles deeming them historic as opposed to comparatively newer classic cars. But if youre using car tax exemption as a cut-off point then any car thats aged 40 years or older is a classic. For that reason they set rules stating what qualifies as antique. Its partially a matter of passion.</p>
