<p>Mahogonycrafter Com Indonesia Furniture Mahogany Crafter Antique Reproduction Furniture Custom Furniture Antique Reproduction Furniture Furniture Care Cuban mahogany is a very dense heavy and dark timber from the West Indies. Honduras mahogany is a lighter weight mahogany and easy to work with it comes from the mainland around Honduras. In older furniture such as English Georgian case pieces from the 1800s this process commonly results in fissures along grain lines on tops doors or sides. Since these furniture serve the purpose for which they are created we also need to take good care of them so that they can be used for long. It was very popular as it is a hardwood so is durable solid and easy to work with when building antique furniture by cabinet makers.</p>
