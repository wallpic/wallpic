Fueling that vintage muscle car with the Right Stuff. In the 1980s it was decided that the increasing collective lead content was too toxic and as such unleaded gas was introduced in the mid-1970s and leaded gas was subsequently phased out and withdrawn from the gas market. By the turn of the century less than 10 per cent of all cars in Britain will need leaded petrol and it may not be as widely available as it is today. Installing hardened valves and valve seats in the engine takes care of the first while high octane gas will take care of the second.</p>

Most of the time the lean fuel mixtures were the result of vacuum leaks from vacuum lines and intake manifolds. In the 1980s it was decided that the increasing collective lead content was too toxic and as such unleaded gas was introduced in the mid-1970s and leaded gas was subsequently phased out and withdrawn from the gas market. This allows moist air into the tank which gets absorbed by the ethanol in the gas separates out as water accumulates at the bottom of the tank and causes running problems and rust in the tank. By the turn of the century less than 10 per cent of all cars in Britain will need leaded petrol and it may not be as widely available as it is today.</p>

Its no longer legal to put leaded gas in your car though whether its a classic or not. When lead was added to fuel in the past it did three things. So you could end up with valve recession. It has been the rule since 1975 when automakers made the fuel filler neck smaller so the wider nozzle of leaded gas pumps could not fit in.</p>
