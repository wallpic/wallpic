<p>Bat Kings Island Kings Mills Ohio Usa Kings Island Amusement Park Kings Island Amusement Park Rides Les Taxis closed in 2004 to make way for The Italian Job. In the new Kings Mills Antique Autos family ride guests will board replica classic touring cars and take a leisurely drive around a scenic track equipped with a small rail to keep the car on the pathThe ride will be comparable to the original Les Taxis antique car ride pictured. One of my older sisters was diagnoses with Lupus when she was in the 6th grade. The Kings Island Antique Autos will come in four colors blue red white and yellow. Back on August 16th Kings Island announced that they would be bringing back the antique car ride a ride that was removed from the park 14 years ago in 2004.</p>

<p>After A 14 Year Hiatus Kings Island Is Bringing Back Their Antique Cars Attraction In A Whole New Way Fo Kings Island Amusement Park Kings Island Antique Cars Kings Mills Antique Autos are located in Coney Mall across from the Juke Box Café and alongside The Racer roller coaster. The cars are 23 scale replicas of the 1911 Ford Model T. The antique cars will be located in the Coney Mall section of Kings Island just across from the Juke Box Café.
