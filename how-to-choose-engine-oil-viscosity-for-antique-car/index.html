<p><strong>How To Choose Engine Oil Viscosity For Antique Car</strong>, In most warm countries 20W50 is the normal oil recommended. Your car handbook will tell you the grade s and therefore the viscosity that you should use. To determine the correct viscosity for an application you need to know the operating temperature of the oil in that application.</p>

<p>Here are three tips to help you make an informed decision. Startup is when most wear occurs so a lower viscosity better enables the oil pump to get oil around the engine quickly. A conventional API CE 20W-50 oil thats ideal for older engine designs plus a dedicated 60 oil thats specifically aimed at higher mileage units.</p>
<h3 id="some-manufacturers-now-offer-synthetic-oil-that-includes-high-amounts-of-zinc-as-an-additive">Some manufacturers now offer synthetic oil that includes high amounts of zinc as an additive.</h3><p>At a very basic level the oil-filler cap on top of your engine will sometimes list the viscosity rating of the oil it requires. Viscosity is a measurement of oils weight and actually describes how thick the oil is. Oil tends to thicken or increase in viscosity at low temperatures and thin out or decrease in viscosity at higher temperatures. This enables the 5w20 motor oil to reach engine parts quicker and create less drag that reduces fuel economy. The second number refers to the viscosity when the oil is hot.</p>

<p>1946 Ford Sportsman Woody Coupe Brochure Usa Car Ads Classic Cars Vintage Cars My local auto accessories store owner who has a number of classic and vintage vehicles says 10W30 oils werent around then so I dont know who to believe. And even fewer actually know that the choice of engine oil depends on the season or climate the car is used in. A fully synthetic motor oil warms quickly which means it lubricates the engine faster during cold starts and since its fully-refined it doesnt have any minerals that could eventually foul up your engine. 30 or 40 is probably what would be right for your car. A fellow who has an original owners manual for a 1964 EH Holden says it recommends to use an SAE 20 or a 10W30 engine oil.</p>

<p>1941 Ad Chrysler Group Llc Tailored Car Seat Cover Blue Car Woman Driv Chrysler Car Advertising Chrysler Group Llc 5w30 motor oil the 20 indicates that the oil has a lower viscosity and is thinner at higher temperatures. So a 5W-30 will flow easier than a 10W-30 at start-up temperatures and a 10W-30 will flow easier than a 10W-40 at normal engine operating temperatures. All modern oil is much better than the old stuff. The heavier oil will also reduce blow-by which tends to force oil into air cleaner when the PVC system gets overloaded. Thicker oils have more resistance to shearing and losing film strength at higher temperatures.</p>

This is the oils viscosity expressed as a number like 5W-20. For example motor oil displaying 20w50 simply told us that the oil performed like a 20w single grade when cold and a 50w single grade when hot. The 5 in this example is the cold viscosity and 20 is the hot viscosity at the engines full running temp.</p>
