<p>Pin On Route 66 Car Museum Well its pretty much anything before 1918 but the Antique Automobile Club of America defines it as any vehicle. Vehicles registered as Classic are required to have an annual safety inspection. A car must be at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. The procedure of applying for a car registration cannot be completed unless motorists meet the eligibility requirements and submit the proper documents as well as payment for the applicable fees to an MD MVA office.</p>

<p>Does It Get Cooler Than All This Chrome Classic Style Design Beauty Cars Carshow Cool Car Pictures Car Show Classic Cars The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. Antique vehicles operated exclusively between sunrise and sunset are exempt from the normal lighting requirements of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code but must have their original lighting equipment. In addition to the required paperwork motorists will be also required to pay certain fees for their custom or antique. Flea markets with antique stands antique shops and antique malls are plentiful so dealers have a lot of competition in stocking their shops. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years.</p>
