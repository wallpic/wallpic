<p>Opel Super Six Cabrio Opel Car Buying Antique Cars I define vintage as 20-40 years old and antique as older than 40 years oldbut clearly it is item specific eg radios cars etc. One additional fact to know is that in automobile you can consider it an antique if it reaches over 25 years of age. Youre wondering if your old car is an antique and whether or not it classifies for the Antique Exempt status from your state. I photographed this 1929 Ford A in New Zealand this year. This is based on the definition given by most of the worldwide organization and the Antique Automobile Club of America.</p>

<p>1916 Chevrolet Baby Grand Hyman Ltd Classic Cars Classic Cars Antique Cars Chevrolet Theres no real strict definition when it comes to these things and Im sure it varies from country to country but as I understand it antique cars fit in between classic and vintage. For that reason they set rules stating what qualifies as antique In most cases it is a car thats over 45 years old. Licensed Florida drivers can apply for an FL antique vehicle registration and special vintage license plates if the car they own is for private use is at least 30 years old and has been manufactured after 1945. But determining whether you have a vintage or classic car can sometimes be confusing. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years.</p>

<p>1968 Oldsmobile Tornado Auto Refrigerator Tool Box Magnet Oldsmobile Toronado Oldsmobile Old Classic Cars Typically an antique vehicle is defined by its age at the time at which antique vehicle. In the UK 25 years and over are classed as classic cars and over 40 years vintage. Answer 1 of 3. For insurance and registration purposes the age of a classic car in most cases is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years.</p>
