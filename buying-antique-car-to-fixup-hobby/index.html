<p>Children Used To Play With These Now Grownups Collect Them Children Play With All Kinds Of Tech Stuff Corgi Toys Toys Hobby Toys I love antique cars and Ive owned a couple in the past but I bought them already in good condition. I never go near them no matter how tempting they are price wise. I know manymost people who own classic cars like to work on the cars themselves and know something about restoring fixing and maintaining them. The Antique Automobile Club of America is the countrys largest antique auto club and defines an antique car as anything over 20-years-old. For serious car collectors buying and fixing up old cars isnt just a hobby - its a lifestyle.</p>
