<p>Ac Six Year 1920 1929 Front Antique Cars Vintage Cars Picture Auto insurance laws 20 years of life for a car is approximately double the expectancy intended for most modern cars so the classic car title sets in after a car is 20 years old. It is possible for it to have been manufactured the previous year but not registered and import vehicles may not have the correct year specific registration number. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. Collectibles can be anything collectible. Whether or not your car is considered an antique depends on who youre asking and what state you live in.</p>

<p>1939 Ford Deluxe Coupe Car Ford Ford Antique Cars But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition. If the vehicle is at least 21 years old there are no EPA compliance requirements upon importation. I define vintage as 20-40 years old and antique as older than 40 years oldbut clearly it is item specific eg radios cars etc. Using these cookie cutter definitions as standard would mean there is no such thing as antique radios. A custom built car is one that was completely manufactured with custom parts and the make will have to include custom built in the name to show this off even more.</p>

For that reason they set rules stating what qualifies as antique In most cases it is a car thats over 45 years old. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. Generally classic or antique vehicles are exempt from Environmental Protection Agency EPA and Department of Transportation DOT pollution and safety requirements. Namely the state classifies any auto that is more than 25 years old or manufactured after 1915 as an antique motor vehicle.</p>
