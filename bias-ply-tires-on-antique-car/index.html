<p>I dont remenber seeing any 16 bias ply tires from Coker that are tubeless so your only choice is to break down the tire remove and patch the tube. With radials and belted bias ply tires the outer belts keep the tread more flat on the road which means they dont need air pressure to do that as the bias ply tires do. BUT sidewall stiffness due to increased inflation pressure in addition to any internal bead area stiffeners in the tire itself result in crisper and more responsive steering inputs.</p>

Driving the car at first I noticed a vibration on the highway and assumed it was the tires by reputation. BUT sidewall stiffness due to increased inflation pressure in addition to any internal bead area stiffeners in the tire itself result in crisper and more responsive steering inputs. In the vintage car market bias ply tires feature a narrow tread profile with a sharp shoulder that usually has a piecrust look.
