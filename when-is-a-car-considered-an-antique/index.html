While there are still slight variations even among DMVs most allow a car to be considered an antique when it reaches 25 years of age. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars. For instance antique car registration documents are available for vehicles that were manufactured prior to 1981. Vintage means any stuff that is at least 20 years old.</p>

<p>Hispano Suiza Best Luxury Cars Antique Cars Classic Cars A car may be a personal use asset in terms of subsection 108-202 if it is used or kept mainly for your or your associates personal use or enjoyment. In either case it remains a car for the purposes of section 118-5 and any capital gain or capital loss made on it is disregarded under that section. Answer 1 of 4. A car must be at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars.</p>

<p>Chapron Delahaye 135ms Cabriolet 1938 Delahaye Delahaye Cars Cabriolets A car may be a collectible in terms of subsection 108-102 if it is an antique. I would use the world antique in the car world as something built in 1942 or older. Antique vehicle registration is open to anything older than 25 years but the restrictions are well defined. Antique vehicle registration is a special form of motor vehicle registration for vehicles that are considered antique classic vintage or historicBoth the specific term used and the definition of a qualifying vehicle vary from country to country as well as within a country if it is a federation. I define vintage as 20-40 years old and antique as older than 40 years oldbut clearly it is item specific eg radios cars etc.</p>

<p>Read The Internet Site Above Click The Link For Additional Alternatives Classic Car Insurance Quote Mobil Klasik The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. I would use the world antique in the car world as something built in 1942 or older. The Classic Car Club of America is even stricter in their description of classics. Is 1980 considered vintage. The word Antique of course just refers to something from the long past and is therefore considered to be quite old.</p>
