<p>Alvis Are Back After A Brief Hiatus With 2016 Classic S Classic Cars Classic Antique Cars As far as I know this is the only term that has legal meaning. As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. By contrast American Collectors Insurance says an antique car is one manufactured in 1975 or earlier. But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition.</p>

<p>1935 A C 1670 Dhc Rhd White Car Tiny Cars Classic Cars But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition. Some automotive organisations may refer to a car made in the 1940s as a Classic while others my consider cars from the 1980s to Classics. An antique vehicle adds Greer is generally at least 30 years old which is the minimum age for historic or vintage plates in many provinces. For instance many DMVs define a classic car as any vehicle over 15-25 years old and the Classic Car club of American defines classic cars as a fine or distinctive automobile either American or foreign built produced between 1925 and 1948. An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law.</p>
