<p>Horch 853 Stromlinien Coupe 1937 Vintage Cars Classic Cars Retro Cars I am in the process of purchasing an older Corvette which would. In 19 years I have been pulled over probably about 5 times for various reasons. Any misgivings from the previous 25 years of automotive development have been sorted and you should have no problem piloting these on a daily basis. Last time registration was up I purchased collector plates and joined the BMW club. Operating an antiquecollector vehicle in violation of states law is often a misdemeanor and may mean revocation of the vehicles antiquecollector status.</p>

<p>Pin On C A R S There is nothing stopping you provided the classic car in question is compliant with current road rules and regulations and you are able to have it insured to drive on the road etc. Last time registration was up I purchased collector plates and joined the BMW club. First of all the statue says you cant exceed 250 miles from your residence Secondly you can use your car for general daily transportation which includes but is not limited to driving to and from work Nevertheless theres a significant advantage to obtaining antique plates. Never once has a cop even asked about the plate or even mentioned it during the stop. It appears that some vehicles with antique plates are driving daily and I was wondering if I would be allowed to do the same.</p>

<p>Good Color And Ideal Plate Ferrari 250california 250california Colour Ferrari Perfect Plate Classic Cars Best Classic Cars Car Wheels Quite simply the intent of the restrictions on antique plates is to keep those vehicles from being used for everyday transportation. Some people register their vehicles as antiques but use them for everyday driving and thats OK. Like someone quoted above you can drive the vehicle if you are working on it or going somewhere to work on it. Using the Antique Vehicle Applicant Certification you must also certify that you own or have regular use of another vehicle without antique plates for daily use and that the vehicle or trailer you want to register with antique plates can be driven safely on the highways of Virginia. Insurance company said up to 10000 per year.</p>
