<p>Pin On Distinguished Cars 1920 1954 Most states figure a car must be at least 25 years old to qualify as an antique. When this was first introduced a car needs to be more than 25 years old to be eligible. Once a vehicle like this is 25 years old it is an antique in State Farms eyes and is no longer eligible for classic car insurance. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car.</p>
