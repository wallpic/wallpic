<p>Cars Worth Millions To Be Auctioned At Amelia Island Fiat Fiat Cars Amelia Island Also I wish we could get Rivertown theming closer to what CP has for Frontiertown. Thats right an antique cars ride is returning to Kings Island 14 years after leaving the park to make way for what is now Backlot Stunt Coaster formerly Italian Job Stunt Track. The ride will be located in the Coney Mall section of the park running alongside The Racer roller coaster and across from Shake Rattle Roll and the Juke Box. The ride is a quarter mile in length and lasts approximately three minutes. The announcement was made 14 years to the day that Kings Islands first version of the Antique Cars attraction closed to make way for the Italian Job.</p>
