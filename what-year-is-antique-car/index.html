Depending on how you plan to use your vehicle you may choose antique vintage or any one of our standard license plates. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. The registration is the date the vehicle was first registered in the UK. You should supply the mandatory documentation when registering vintage vehicles.</p>

<p>A Magnificent Packard But What Model And Year 70 Pieces Antique Cars Vintage Cars Custom Muscle Cars There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently. Some states though allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years while others require it to be older. An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law. I have heard the term true vintage as being at least 50 years old.</p>

<p>Packard Year Unknown Classic Cars Packard Motor Car Thats actually not that old when you think about it. It is possible for it to have been manufactured the previous year but not registered and import vehicles may not have the correct year specific registration number. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently. I have heard the term true vintage as being at least 50 years old. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.</p>
