<p>Chevrolet Collectible Antique Car 1924 Vintage Cars Car Advertising Car Ads These vehicles are used mainly for their parts which can be used to restore other cars. An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law. Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques. To me the most appealing vintage cars are the ones that look great and drive great even if the market for them is soft Cotter says. Whether or not your car is considered an antique depends on who youre asking and what state you live in.</p>

States often have a special type of license plate for these cars. Classic cars dont have to be American-made but they should still contain the original parts from when they were manufactured. A classic car may include a car built before 1930 but the classic era ended in 1948.</p>
