Antique vehicles must be insured with motor vehicle liability insurance or you must pay the uninsured motor vehicle fee. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. Antique license plates are provided by DMV while vintage license plates are original Virginia license plates issued prior to 1976 that you provide.

<p>Pin On Cars To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. Any motor vehicle trailer or semitrailer that is outside the Commonwealth at the time its inspection expires when operated by the most direct route to the owner s or operator s place of residence or the owner s legal place. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique. At the state level permanent antique plates are provided at a one time charge of 50 and if you wish to obtain and use actual original plates of the cars year of manufacture that can be done for the same fee. Different groups set different cut off points for what qualifies as a vintage car and what does not.</p>

With regular plates you need regular inspection. Generally cars that are considered Vintage were manufactured between the years of 1919 and 1930 but some end it at 1925. If you received your antique plate before July 1 2007 but have not submitted the VSA 10B you will have to reapply for antique plates pay the 50 fee and submit the VSA 10B. For a car to be considered a classic it must be more than 20 years old in good condition and true to the original design.</p>
