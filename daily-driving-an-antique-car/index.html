As a long time VW fan I would absolutely recommend the Karmann Ghia. People get excited and nostalgic and they want to share in the experience. The 1964½ models though hard to find drive the way an American classic should. If only it was that simple.</p>

<p>Gnrs Indoor Goodness The Daily Driver Project Indoor Good Things Antique Cars I drove a 1968 Plymouth Valiant as a daily driver a few years ago for about a year. The 1964½ models though hard to find drive the way an American classic should. Theyre very comfortable in traffic a blast to drive in. Everyone loves to see the car and thinks you are cool for driving an old car. This bargain British GTs combination of plastic body simple Ford oily bits and huge Tom Ogle-designed shooting brake rear make it a surprisingly practical daily driver.</p>
