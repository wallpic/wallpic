If the seat is not equipped with a belt from the factory you dont have to wear a belt. You definitely need seat belts. Section 106 HTA requires drivers and passengers to occupy a seating position in a motor vehicle as opposed to sitting in the cargo area of a van and wear the complete seatbelt assembly.</p>

<p>On Twitter Classic Cars Vintage Dream Cars Classy Cars 55 ears ago I rode in a small car in a test of seat belts at my Air Force Base. I found it all by searching google. Johnsons Highway Safety Act made the seat belt mandatory for manufacturers and ultimately buckling up became law for drivers and later passengers as well. You can register your vehicle as an antique and pay a reduced fee but that only entitles you to drive your vehicle in parades and to shows. Seat belts are not required for any 2a Landrovers but if fitted should not be removed must be in good condition and must be used if fitted.</p>

<p>Ferrari Car Guys Classic Cars Cars Trucks It has been a legal requirement in the UK since 1965 that all cars must have anchorage points fitted in the front of new cars and two years later in 1967 for seat belts to be fitted in front seats. Every one in the car should be buckled. Children under 1 year of age in a rear facing car seat. With all of that in mind lets take a look at Arizonas seat belt laws to make sure you know exactly what is expected of you. Those over 4 years and 40 pounds can sit in a booster seat.</p>
