<p>Pin On Vintage Auto Ads The axiom that old cars require hardened seats to run on unleaded comes from the age old practice of machining the valve seat faces directly in to the cast iron head. They are designed to offer the protection that leaded fuel once did and are quite easy to add if you are adept at measuring and following instructions. They have always have alloy heads with hardened steel valve seats phosphor bronze valve guides which dont need additional lubrication and need only low octane rated gasoline. For this reason if you choose to run your vintage car on just unleaded petrol and want to drive it frequently then you will need to use a lead replacement additive.

Most gas stations or car parts stores stock a range of these additives. If the fuel mixture went lean too much air and not enough fuel the computer would allow additional fuel to be added to the engine. Right or wrong and this is a case of it depends this does not apply to Jaguars or any car with an aluminum head. But remember that many standard fuels on the forecourt now contain up to 10 ethanol so you need to do your research and find one thats got the lowest amount of ethanol you can possibly find.</p>
