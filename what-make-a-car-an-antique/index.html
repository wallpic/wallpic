<p>Le Zebre France L Car France Antique Cars Possibly the biggest reason that people want to get antique plates is because of lower insurance premiums. As of 2014 many states vehicle registries consider an antique car one that was built after 1922 and is at least 20 years old. The Antique car era 1890-1915 is when vehicles were built by small teams of innovative engineers artisans and craftsmen. Id say the Studebaker Hawk was the first one they innovate. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.</p>

<p>Oldsmobile 1936 Oldsmobile Car Ads Antique Cars A classic car generally refers to a car 30 years old or older that is unique in popularity both when made and throughout the years. However many people define classic cars as those that are between 20 and 40 years old. While other states will push that back to anything made. In fact Hot Cars reports that cars with antique license plates can only be driven to and from car shows and exhibitions in many states. If there are quite a few of the vintage cars available purchasing one with the expectation of reselling it at a profit may be a risky investment.</p>
