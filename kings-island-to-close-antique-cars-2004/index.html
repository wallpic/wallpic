But why in the world does Cedar Point have two Antique Car tracks but Kings Island have none. Heres what weve been working on. Originally named Les Taxis the antique cars were an opening day attraction for Kings Island. Since the the Antique cars are supposed to be removed does any one have any last memories of this ride.</p>

<p>Tumblr In 2020 Packard Vintage Cars Packard Cars The ride was operational between 1972 and 2004 when. In-between nostalgia is in complete swing with a return of the storied attraction for babies. An antique car ride where guests could drive their own gas-powered car around the track with help from a guide rail. One of my older sisters was diagnoses with Lupus when she was in the 6th grade. While not as old as some of the vintage park photos from Walt Disney World I shared earlier these pictures from Kings Island taken in 1996 are quite interesting to look at.</p>

<p>Pin On Car The Antique Cars were an original Kings Island attraction and operated in that space from 1972-2004. It was one of the parks most beloved attractions open at the park from 1972 to 2004. Adam drove me around the new Kings Island Antque Cars. The unique Les Taxis ride which closed in 2004. One of my older sisters was diagnoses with Lupus when she was in the 6th grade.</p>
