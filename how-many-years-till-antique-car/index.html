<p>Pin By Michel Van Der Linden On American Cars Trucks From 40ties And 50 60ties And 70ties Classic Cars Trucks Classic Cars Vintage Pontiac During the 1930s and 1940s a VIN number would look quite different from what youre used to today. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars. A hobby antique vehicle is a motor vehicle that is over 25 years old and which has been manufactured to look like an antique or historical vehicle. But determining whether you have a vintage or classic car can sometimes be confusing.</p>

<p>1951 Ford Victoria Car Ads Vintage Trucks Vintage Cars 1950s There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. But if youre using car tax exemption as a cut-off point then any car thats aged 40 years or older is a classic. Vehicles that are used for private purposes and manufactured in 1945 or in the previous years will be considered ancient vehicles. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. It is antique when it is.</p>

<p>1909 Benz 24 45 25 45 Six Seat Sporting Tourer Classic Driver Market Benz Classic Cars Classic Cars Vintage You can use the same standard to call it vintage which means about the same thing. Vehicles that are used for private purposes and manufactured in 1945 or in the previous years will be considered ancient vehicles. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. However if you choose to apply for registration remember. This leads us to the word Collectible.</p>
